# vscode-laravel-config
The goal is to provide a good config to start using Laravel.
That means correct settings for PHP, Laravel, Javascript, CSS, HTML, SCSS, VUE...

This is a first draft so if you have some ideas how to improve it, please PR.

This config is used with vscode 1.22.2


# Installation of Extensions
To make the config work, you will need to first install all extensions I use.
Just copy paste the content of the "application_list" file in a terminal.

Personnal note, code to generate all extensions installed : code --list-extensions | xargs -L 1 echo code --install-extension


# User Settings
Then copy paste the content of the user settings and set the correct executable path at the beginning of the file.


# Special Thanks
Benny (https://stackoverflow.com/users/2243665/benny) for the line to generate the extension list :)
